# Data Structures

## Introduction
Data structures are fundamental components in computer science, providing a way to organize, manage, and store data efficiently. They consist of data values, their relationships, and the operations that can be performed on the data.

## Uses of Data Structures
Data structures play a crucial role in various aspects of computing:

1. **Abstract Data Types**: They serve as the foundation for abstract data types, enabling the creation of higher-level data structures with specific behaviors and characteristics.

2. **Efficient Data Management**: Data structures are essential for efficiently managing large amounts of data, as seen in applications like large databases and internet indexing services.

3. **Storage and Retrieval**: Data structures help in organizing and retrieving information stored in both primary (main memory) and secondary (e.g., disk storage) memory.

## Types of Data Structures
Data structures can be classified into different categories:

1. **Primitive vs. Non-Primitive**: Data structures are categorized as primitive (basic data types like integers, floats) or non-primitive (more complex structures that can hold multiple values).

2. **Non-Primitive**: Non-primitive data structures are further categorized as linear and non-linear.

    - **Linear Data Structures**: These include structures where elements are arranged sequentially. Examples are arrays, linked lists, stacks, and queues.

    - **Non-Linear Data Structures**: These are structures where elements are connected in a more complex manner. Trees and graphs fall into this category.

3. **Linear Data Structures**: Linear data structures are classified as static and dynamic.

    - **Static Data Structures**: These have a fixed size, and the memory is allocated at compile-time. Arrays are a common example.

    - **Dynamic Data Structures**: These have a flexible size, and memory is allocated at runtime. Examples include linked lists, stacks, and queues.
